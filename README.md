# Vizor

The simplest implementation of a blog website that I could think of, written in v

## Installation

1. Install vlang on your computer
2. Run ``` v run . ``` or ``` v . ```

## Use

V creates a single binary that holds all the required html pages, but vizor requires you to create additional files and folders to read from

1. Create folder called "pages" in the same directory with a file called "home", "links"
2. Create another directory in pages/ called "posts"

These files are what the program looks for to create the different pages
